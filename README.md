Hero Section uses a full-screen background image with filter effects (sepia, brightness, saturate) to give it a retro, roasted-bean feel.
Button Styling: The Explore Menu button is designed with hover transitions and vintage border coloring for visibility.
Form Section: Styled with simple yet elegant inputs and layout using flexbox for alignment.
Preloader: A full-screen preloader using a GIF (background: url(...) no-repeat center) fades out once content loads.
